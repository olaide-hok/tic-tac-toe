## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
-   **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
-   **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) - This helped me for CSS Grid. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
